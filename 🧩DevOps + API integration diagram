🎯 Goal:
Integration and Automation of APIs in a Ticket Booking System (like BookMyShow)
We'll design a complete DevOps-oriented API workflow with automation and include a pictorial diagram to visualize how it works.

🔧 1. Workflow Components
✅ Key Modules in a Ticket Booking App
Frontend: React/Angular-based UI

Backend (API Layer): Node.js / Python (Flask or FastAPI)

Database: MySQL / MongoDB

Authentication: JWT / OAuth

Payment Gateway: Razorpay / Stripe API

Movie/Event Data: External API integration (e.g., TMDb for movie info)

DevOps Automation: CI/CD, Monitoring, Alerts

🔁 2. API Integration Workflow
🧩 API Use Cases
Functionality	API Used	Automation
🎟 Show Listings	GET /api/shows	Cached daily
📍 Location-based Filter	GET /api/locations	Dynamic, user IP-based
🕒 Show Timing/Availability	GET /api/shows/:id/times	Real-time
💺 Seat Booking	POST /api/booking	Validated via webhook
💳 Payment Gateway	POST /api/payments/checkout	External API
📧 Email Confirmation	POST /api/notify/email	Triggered after payment
🔁 Refund/Cancellation	POST /api/refund	Auto-triggered via time rule
📈 Logs & Monitoring	POST /api/logs	Sent to ELK/Prometheus stack
